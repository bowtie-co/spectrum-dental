  <h4><strong>How to choose a General Dentist</strong></h4>
  <p>Chances are you already have a dentist and are perfectly happy. However, when it comes to dental implants, it is important that you find out whether he or she is proficient in the restorative dentistry skills that are required. If your dentist is not an ASIRD member, be sure to ask how many dental implant cases he/she completed last year. Ask about the surgeon that will be placing your implant. Do they collaborate together as a team? Or are you simply being referred to the surgeon for the implant placement and then directed back to your dentist to finish the restoration?</p>
