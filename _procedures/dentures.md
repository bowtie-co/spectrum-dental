    title: What to Expect
    text: After a treatment plan is created, we'll appoint you with a qualified surgeon to discuss the placement of your dental implant(s). When healing is completed, we'll place your new teeth on the implants. It's really one of the simplest treatments we provide and as a dentist and surgeon team, we want to make sure you have an excellent experience!
