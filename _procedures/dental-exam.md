    text: A thorough examination is a critical first step when visiting our office. In order to properly diagnose your condition and create a treatment plan, we must spend some time making sure that we understand your oral health and any problems that you have. If you have more complex problems, our team will review the findings of the examination and develop treatment options for your review at a separate visit. Proper diagnosis and treatment planning comes first!
