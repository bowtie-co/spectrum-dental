    title: What to Expect
    text: Evaluation for sleep apnea begins with a sleep study. Sleep centers monitor you while you sleep and determine the number of times you stop sleeping and the oxygen level in your body. If severe enough, you'll have many options for treatment. In many instances, a non-invasive treatment can be completed in our office. A simple, but sophisticated mouth piece can be made to hold your jaw in a position that keeps your airway open. We're happy to evaluate you for this treatement.
