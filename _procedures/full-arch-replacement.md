    title: Summary
    img_path:
    text: Full Arch dental replacement can be a transformative experience. If you are missing teeth or they must be removed, most times dental implants can be placed the same day. Additionally you may be a candidate to have new teeth the same day as well. Imagine having a completely new smile in one day!

    title: Why Consider
    img_path:
    text: Restoring function and appearance of your smile is important for your health and self-confidence. When teeth must be removed, there is no better way to get you back to eating properly. Dentures and other substitutions restore very little of your ability to eat while replacing your teeth with implants can be a life-changing experience.
