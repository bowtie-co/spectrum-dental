    title: Why Consider
    img_path:
    text: Dental bridges are a substitute for a missing tooth. In most instances, a missing tooth should be replaced by a dental implant. If this is not possible, a bridge may be recommended.

    title: What to Expect
    text: The teeth adjacent to a missing tooth are prepared as a crown. A temporary is made for several weeks while your bridge is created. A second appointment is made to remove the temporary and place the bridge. Special cleaning instructions are given to prevent decay of the supporting teeth. It is critical to use extreme care of dental bridges as decay can cause loss of the supporting tooth and your bridge.
