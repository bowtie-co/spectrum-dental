    title: What to Expect
    text: At-home solutions are easy to accomplish. We'll make you thin trays to wear over your teeth and provide you with gel whitening solution. We'll teach you how to use the whitening system and in just a few minutes a day, your teeth can be dramatically whiter! If you are having tooth sensitivity issues after using the the whitening gel, don't worry. This is expected and will go away over time or when whitening is completed. Please remember, whitening requires maintenance. Coffee, tea, sodas, and natural coloration will require you to periodically touch up your smile with your whitening system.
