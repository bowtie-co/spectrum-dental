<h5 id="this-notice-describes-how-medical-information-about-you-may-be-used-and-disclosed-and-how-you-can-get-access-to-this-information-please-review-it-carefully">This notice describes how medical information about you may be used and disclosed and how you can get access to this information. Please review it carefully!</h5>

<p>With your consent, the practice is permitted by federal privacy laws to make uses and disclosures of your health information for purposes of treatment, payment, and healthcare operations. Protected health information is the information we create and obtain in providing our services to you. Such information may include documenting your symptoms, examination and test results, diagnoses, treatment, and applying for future care or treatment. It also includes billing documents for those services.</p>

<h5 id="example-of-use-of-your-health-information-for-treatment-purposes">Example of Use of Your Health Information for Treatment Purposes:</h5>
<p>A nurse obtains treatment information about you and records it in a health record. During the course of your treatment, the doctor determines a need to consult with another specialist in the area. The doctor will share the information with such specialist and obtain input.</p>

<h5 id="example-of-use-of-your-health-information-for-payment-purposes">Example of Use of Your Health Information for Payment Purposes:</h5>
<p>We submit a request for payment to your health insurance company. The health insurance company requests information from us regarding medical care given. We will provide information to them about you and the care given.</p>

<h5 id="example-of-use-of-your-information-for-healthcare-operations">Example of Use of Your Information for Healthcare Operations:</h5>
<p>We obtain services from our insurers or other business associates such as quality assessment, quality improvement, outcome evaluation, protocol and clinical guidelines development, training programs, credentialing, medical review, legal services, and insurance. We will share information about you with such insurers or other business associates as necessary to obtain these services.</p>

<h2 id="your-health-information-rights">Your Health Information Rights</h2>
<p>The health record we maintain and billing records are the physical property of the practice. The information in it, however, belongs to you. You have a right to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Request a restriction on certain uses and disclosures of your health information by delivering the request in writing to our office. We are not required to grant the request, but we will comply with any request granted.</li>
  <li>Request that you be allowed to inspect and copy your health record and billing record — you may exercise this right by delivering the request in writing to our office.
Appeal a denial of access to your protected health information except in certain circumstances.</li>
  <li>Request that your healthcare record be amended to correct incomplete or incorrect information by delivering a written request to our office.
File a statement of disagreement if your amendment is denied, and require that the request for amendment and any denial be attached in all future disclosures of your protected health information.</li>
  <li>Obtain an accounting of disclosures of your health information as required to be maintained by law by delivering a written request to our office. An accounting will not include internal uses of information for treatment, payment, or operations, disclosures made to you or made at your request, or disclosures made to family members or friends in the course of providing care.</li>
  <li>Request that communication of your health information be made by alternative means or at an alternative location by delivering the request in writing to our office.
Revoke authorizations that you made previously to use or disclose information except to the extent information or action has already been taken by delivering a written revocation to our office.</li>
</ul>
