For patients that are born with severe dental deformities or who experience loss of dental structures as a result of traumatic injuries, more extensive reconstruction may be indicated. These patients often require facial plastic surgery, jaw surgery, orthodontics, or dental implants. This type of extensive reconstruction requires an interdisciplinary approach to solve very complex problems. Dr. Laurell and Purcell not only provide all of the tooth restoration needs, but also facilitate the coordination of all of the disciplines and individual practitioners to ensure an exceptional comprehensive treatment result.
