Our office uses the newest and most current form of dental x-rays. Instead of placing the x-ray film in your mouth, taking the picture, and then developing it with a series of chemicals, we use a computer sensor. The sensor is placed in your mouth, the picture is taken, and then, almost instantly processed by the computer. This procedure is more comfortable for most patients, but also faster, thereby decreasing the amount of radiation exposure significantly. Both our routine dental x-rays and our panoramic x-rays are digital.

We also have the capability to do a 3-dimensional scan of your teeth, gums and jaw using technology similar to a Cat-scan used in medical radiology.

We have digital Radiographs to provide the most accurate X-Ray with the lowest possible radiation dose to the patient. We use X-Rays to detect hidden dental structures, malignant or benign masses, bone loss and cavities.
